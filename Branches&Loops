Question:
Now that you've seen the if statement and the looping constructs in the C# language, see if you can write C# code to find the sum of all integers 1 through 20 that are divisible by 3. Here are a few hints:

The % operator gives you the remainder of a division operation.
The if statement gives you the condition to see if a number should be part of the sum.
The for loop can help you repeat a series of steps for all the numbers 1 through 20.
Try it yourself. Then check how you did. As a hint, you should get 63 for an answer.

Answer:
int sum = 0;
for (int number = 1; number < 21; number++)
{
    if (number % 3 == 0)
    {
        sum = sum + number;
    }
}
Console.WriteLine($"The sum is {sum}");

Comments:
//the first variable is a holder for the answer
//for statement is used to go through numbers 1 through 20
//if statement checks to see if numbers 1 through 20 are divisible by 3 (no remainders hence the %)
//if "if statement" is true, equation solves for sum
//last line writes out output
